This React Native app has been build on the Expo CLI because it was easier/faster to test it that way, 
it also didn't need any device specific changes to be made

How to test app:
  -install Expo Go on your device
  -terminal
  -head to parent directory
  -type npm start
  -scan QR code, or connect device over wire
  
Things that could be improved:
  -code should be split into multiple files, to improve readability, make more components
  -add support for bigger screens, aka computer browsers, this was specifically made for phones and wasn't tested on tablets
