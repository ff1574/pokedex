This React Native app has been build on the Expo CLI because it was easier/faster to test it that way,
it also didn't need any device specific changes to be made

How to test app:

-install Expo Go on your device

-terminal

-head to parent directory

-type `npm install` to install dependencies

-type `npm start`

-scan QR code, or connect device over wire

Things that could be improved:

-convert app to React Native CLI
